  A clean and playful attempt at structuring a university website 🌱

## ✨ What is Amrita ProtoWeb?

**Amrita ProtoWeb** is a static website prototype that represents the hierarchical structure of **Amrita University** — from the university level to campuses and then down to individual schools.

This project is built mainly to:
- Learn proper web folder structuring
- Practice clean HTML navigation
- Experiment with UI ideas
- Have fun while building something meaningful 😄

## 🧠 Concept

The idea is simple:

> **University → Campus → School**

Each level has its own page and folder, making the structure easy to understand, expand, and maintain.

Think of this as a **map of Amrita University**, but on the web 🌍

## 🧭 How Navigation Works

- The **main page** acts as the university entry point
- From there, users can explore:
  - Different **campuses**
  - Schools available within each campus
- Every page is connected logically to reflect real-world structure

## 🖼️ Media & Assets

This includes:
- University logos
- Campus images
- Icons and illustrations


## 🎨 Style & Feel

- Simple HTML-based layout
- Clean and readable structure
- Focus on clarity over complexity
- Designed as a **prototype**, not a production site
- A mix of academic + fun vibes 

## 🚀 Why This Project?

This project is meant to be:
- A **learning playground** for web development
- A **prototype** for understanding large website structures
- A **base** that can later grow into something bigger
- A reminder that learning can be fun 

## 🔮 Ideas for the Future

Some cool directions this could go in:
- Shared CSS and JavaScript files
- Better responsiveness for mobile
- Animations and transitions
- Search or filter by campus/school
- Conversion to a framework like React or Vue
- Accessibility improvements
